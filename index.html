                        that is produced by vibrational motion of objects. It travels in

                        oscillatory motion. The to-and-fro motion of an object is called vibration. Vibrations produce
                        various forms of energy, one of them is sound. Various objects vibrate in to produce sound. You
                        know
                        that there are a variety of musical instruments producing different type of sounds. Which part
                        of
                        the tabla, guitar or flute
                        vibrates? In a tabla, the two membranes vibrate and produce sound, whereas in case of a guitar,
                        the
                        strings vibrate. In a flute, the air column vibrates, producing sound. In humans sound is
                        produced
                        by an organ called larynx (commonly called voice box). When we speak, air rushes out of our
                        lungs to
                        larynx via windpipe. Larynx is located at top end of the windpipe. On the top of larynx there
                        are two membranes called vocal folds (commonly called vocal cords), which begins to vibrate when
                        of
                        air rushes in from below. There are muscles in the larynx that lengthen and shorten the vocal
                        cords
                        and alter the tension to produce different pitches. The space between the vocal fold is called
                        glottis. Different sound can be made by varying opening and closing of the glottis. Our mouth,
                        tongue teeth, lips and nasal cavity also helps us to produce basic sound.

                    <div class="topic-text" style="width: 97.5%">Vibrations cause
                        waves in the air. We hear the sound when these waves reach our ears. To
                        understandhow this happens, let us take the example of a drum.
                        When a drum is struck, the membrane on the drum moves backwards and forwards, i.e vibrates. This
                        causes the air molecules surrounding the drum to vibrate. If we imagine the air molecules to be
                        like
                        small balls, a sound wave travelling through air alternatively pushes these balls close together
                        and
                        then pulls them away from each other. The areas where they lie together are called compressions,
                        and
                        the areas where they lie away from one another are called rarefactions. As the sound wave
                        propagates, the molecules themselves do not move from one point to another, they only vibrate
                        about
                        a mean position. It is the effect that propagates and reaches our ears.

                    <div class="topic-text" style="width: 97.5%">Sound can travel in all three mediums (solid,
                        liquid and gases). It cannot travel in vacuum. This is because sound travels by producing a
                        vibration in the molecules of the medium surrounding it and there are no molecules in vacuum.
                        Two
                        astronauts in outer space can see each other in space but cannot hear each other. This is
                        because
                        sound requires a medium to travel as vibrations can be transferred from one particle to another
                        only
                        in a medium. Hence, sound waves cannot travel in vacuum. Thus, we can say that sound needs a
                        medium
                        to travel.

                            propagated by the collisions between the particles, one molecule hitting the next and so
                            forth.
                            Solids are significantly denser than liquids or gases, and this means that the molecules are
                            closer
                            to each other in solids than in liquids and liquids than in gases. This closeness due to
                            density
                            means that they can collide very quickly. Effectively it takes less time for a molecule of a
                            solid
                            to bump into its neighbouring molecule. Due to this advantage, the velocity of sound in a
                            solid
                            is
                            faster than in a gas.
                            The speed of sound in solid is 6000 metres per second, while the speed of sound in steel is
                            equal to
                            5100 metres per second. Another interesting fact about the speed of sound is that sound
                            travels
                            35
                            times faster in diamonds than in the air.

                            than the density of a gas. Therefore, the distances between molecules are more in liquids
                            than
                            in solids but are less than in gases. Hence the speed of sound in liquids lies in between
                            the
                            speed of sound in solids and gases.The speed of sound in water is 1480 metres per second. It
                            is also interesting that the speed may vary between 1450 to 1498 metres per second in
                            distilled water. In contrast, seawaterâ€™s speed is 1531 metres per second when the

                            independent of the density of the medium when it enters a liquid or solid. Since gases
                            expand to
                            fill the given space, density is relatively uniform irrespective of gas type, which isnâ€™t
                            the
                            case with solids and liquids. The velocity of sound in gases is proportional to the square

                            The outer ear comes in all types of shapes and sizes & helps to give each of
                            us our unique appearance. The medical term for the outer ear is auricle or pinna. The
                            outer ear is made up of cartilage and skin. Sound first enters the outer ear. The pinna
                            collects sound waves and direct them to the external auditory canal. In general, the
                            tympanic membrane is called the eardrum. The tympanic membrane is thin and semi-transparent.
                            The external ear is formed by the pinna and the external auditory canal that receives sounds
                            and transmits them to the middle ear via the eardrum. The eardrum is very circular and
                            flexible, and it begins to vibrate when the incoming sound waves strike it.

                            The middle ear consists of three tiny bones and it is filled with air. The bones are known
                            as ossicles. The three bones of the middle ear are named malleus, incus, and stapes. Sound
                            vibration on the tympanic membrane is transmitted further by these three bones. These three
                            bones form a bridge between the eardrum and the inner ear through the oval window that
                            covers the cochlea. A narrow tube called the Eustachian tube is approximately 3.5 cm in
                            length, connects the ear to the outer part of the nose, and acts as an equalizing valve.
                            This valve ensures that the pressure on either side of the eardrum is balanced and that
                            sound can be heard correctly.

                            main structures. The structures are the cochlea and the vestibular system. The main function
                            of the cochlea is to help in hearing. The vestibular system consists of 3 semi-circular
                            canals, saccule, and utricle. The inner ear includes the cochlea, a structure that has a
                            spiral shape similar to a snail shell and is located in the bony labyrinth that has several
                            membranous sections filled with fluids called endolymph. When these liquids move, they will
                            create fluctuations in the cochleaâ€™s which are hair-like structures called stereocilia. And
                            at last, the Organ of Corti transforms the mechanical energy of the sound waves into nerve
                            energy by creating electric impulses and these impulses are then sent to the brain through
                            the auditory or vestibulocochlear nerve.

                        Like any wave, a sound wave too has many characteristics. The six characteristics of sound are
                        amplitude, wavelength, period, frequency, loudness and speed or velocity. To understand sound
                        well, it is imperative for everyone to learn about these characteristics.

                            When a wave passes through a medium, there is a temporary displacement of the particles of
                            the medium from their actual positions. The maximum displacement of these particles of the
                            medium from their actual positions when a wave passes through them can be defined as the
                            amplitude of the wave. In other words, it is used to describe the size of the wave. It is
                            measured in â€˜meter' in the S.I. unit.

                            Wavelength is the minimum distance in which the sound wave repeats itself. It is the length
                            of one complete wave. In a sound wave, the combined length of an adjacent rarefaction and
                            compression is known as the wavelength. It is also important to remember that the distance
                            between the centres of two successive rarefactions and two successive compressions is
                            equivalent to its wavelength. The S.I. unit of wavelength is also metre.

                            vibrations are produced in one second then the frequency of the waves will be 10 Hertz and
                            10 cycles. The frequency of a wave is fixed and it does not change when it passes through
                            different medium. The unit of frequency is Hertz or Hz.

                            Wind musical instruments produced musical sounds by the vibration of air columns inside
                            them. In a wind musical instrument, a column of air enclosed in a wooden tube on metal tube
                            vibrates and produces musical sound. We have to pump air into the wind instrument to make it
                            work and produce sound. For Example: Shehnai, flute, nadaswaram and trumpet.

                            musical instruments produce sounds by the vibrations of thin stretched membrane. A thin
                            membrane fixed tightly over a hollow wooden drum vibrates and produces sound. We have to
                            strike the stretched membrane of the instrument with our hands or with sticks to make it
                            vibrate and produce sound. For Example: Mridangam, tabla, Dholak, drums, Dhapli. When we
                            strike the membrane of mridangam, the sound that we here is not only that of the membranes,
                            but of the whole body of the mridangam.

                            sounds by the vibration of thick plates. The plate type musical instruments are simply
                            beaten to produce musical sounds. The cymbals consist of two concave brass plates. When the
                            two metal plates of cymbals are struck together, they make a ringing musical sound. The bell
                            used in performing Pooja is also a musical instrument. The bell is a hollow metal vessel
                            which emits musical sound when struck with a Hammer fixed inside it. Matka is also a plate
                            type musical instrument which makes sound when struck.

                            Stringed musical instruments produce musical sounds by the vibrations of stretched strings
                            on stretched wires. A string is a piece of thin wire. In a stringed musical instrument, thin
                            metal strings are fixed tightly between two points. When the stretched string of a musical
                            instrument is plucked or bowed with the fingers of our hand, the string starts vibrating and
                            produce sound. These strings are fixed tightly on a large sounding box. The air presents in
                            the sounding box increases the loudness of sound produced by vibrating strings. For example:
                            Sitar, violin, tanpura, Santoor, guitar, piano, ektara etc.
