                        phenomenon
                        that is produced by vibrational motion of objects. It travels from the source to any place in
                        the
                        form of waves. Let us understand in detail how sound is produced.

                    <div class="topic-text" style="width: 97.5%">Sound is associated with vibrational or
                        oscillatory motion. The to-and-fro motion of an object is called vibration. Vibrations produce
                        various forms of energy, one of them is sound. Various objects vibrate in to produce sound. You
                        know
                        that there are a variety of musical instruments producing different type of sounds. Which part
                        of
                        the tabla, guitar or flute
                        vibrates? In a tabla, the two membranes vibrate and produce sound, whereas in case of a guitar,
                        the
                        strings vibrate. In a flute, the air column vibrates, producing sound. In humans sound is
                        produced
                        by an organ called larynx (commonly called voice box). When we speak, air rushes out of our
                        lungs to
                        larynx via windpipe. Larynx is located at top end of the windpipe. On the top of larynx there
                        are two membranes called vocal folds (commonly called vocal cords), which begins to vibrate when
                        of
                        air rushes in from below. There are muscles in the larynx that lengthen and shorten the vocal
                        cords
                        and alter the tension to produce different pitches. The space between the vocal fold is called
                        glottis. Different sound can be made by varying opening and closing of the glottis. Our mouth,
                        tongue teeth, lips and nasal cavity also helps us to produce basic sound.

                    <div class="topic-text" style="width: 97.5%">Vibrations cause
                        waves in the air. We hear the sound when these waves reach our ears. To
                        understandhow this happens, let us take the example of a drum.
                        When a drum is struck, the membrane on the drum moves backwards and forwards, i.e vibrates. This
                        causes the air molecules surrounding the drum to vibrate. If we imagine the air molecules to be
                        like
                        small balls, a sound wave travelling through air alternatively pushes these balls close together
                        and
                        then pulls them away from each other. The areas where they lie together are called compressions,
                        and
                        the areas where they lie away from one another are called rarefactions. As the sound wave
                        propagates, the molecules themselves do not move from one point to another, they only vibrate
                        about
                        a mean position. It is the effect that propagates and reaches our ears.

                    <div class="topic-text" style="width: 97.5%">Sound can travel in all three mediums (solid,
                        liquid and gases). It cannot travel in vacuum. This is because sound travels by producing a
                        vibration in the molecules of the medium surrounding it and there are no molecules in vacuum.
                        Two
                        astronauts in outer space can see each other in space but cannot hear each other. This is
                        because
                        sound requires a medium to travel as vibrations can be transferred from one particle to another
                        only
                        in a medium. Hence, sound waves cannot travel in vacuum. Thus, we can say that sound needs a
                        medium
                        to travel.

                        <div class="topic-text" style="width: 97.5%">Sound is nothing more than a disturbance
                            propagated by the collisions between the particles, one molecule hitting the next and so
                            forth.
                            Solids are significantly denser than liquids or gases, and this means that the molecules are
                            closer
                            to each other in solids than in liquids and liquids than in gases. This closeness due to
                            density
                            means that they can collide very quickly. Effectively it takes less time for a molecule of a
                            solid
                            to bump into its neighbouring molecule. Due to this advantage, the velocity of sound in a
                            solid
                            is
                            faster than in a gas.
                            The speed of sound in solid is 6000 metres per second, while the speed of sound in steel is
                            equal to
                            5100 metres per second. Another interesting fact about the speed of sound is that sound
                            travels
                            35
                            times faster in diamonds than in the air.

                            than the density of a gas. Therefore, the distances between molecules are more in liquids
                            than
                            in solids but are less than in gases. Hence the speed of sound in liquids lies in between
                            the
                            speed of sound in solids and gases.The speed of sound in water is 1480 metres per second. It
                            is also interesting that the speed may vary between 1450 to 1498 metres per second in
                            distilled water. In contrast, seawater’s speed is 1531 metres per second when the
                            temperature is between 20ºC to 25ºC.

                        <div class="topic-text" style="width: 97.5%">We should remember that the speed of sound is
                            independent of the density of the medium when it enters a liquid or solid. Since gases
                            expand to
                            fill the given space, density is relatively uniform irrespective of gas type, which isn’t
                            the
                            case with solids and liquids. The velocity of sound in gases is proportional to the square
                            root
                            of the absolute temperature (measured in Kelvin). Still, it is independent of the frequency
                            of
                            the sound wave or the pressure and the density of the medium. But none of the gases we find
